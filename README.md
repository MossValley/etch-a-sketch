It is primarily made by DOM manipulation. It starts off with a 10x10 grid with a random color and 10% opacity per mouse passover. Upon reset it prompts for the user to input a number of squares (which will occupy the same space in the grid), and assigns a random value between 1 and 100 as default (an input of 0 will default back to 10).
